    <h2>Getting to Puerto Escondido</h2>

    <p>Puerto Escondido is accessible by various means:
    <ul>
        <li><span>By Plane</span>: The closest airport is Puerto Escondido International Airport (PXM), which is just a
            short drive from the town center. Direct flights are available from Mexico City and other major
            Mexican cities.</li>
        <li><span>By Bus</span>: There are several bus services from Oaxaca City, taking about 10-12 hours due to the winding mountain roads.
            It’s a scenic, albeit lengthy, journey.</li>
        <li><span>By Car</span>: Renting a car can provide more flexibility for exploring the surrounding areas. The drive from
            Oaxaca City takes approximately seven hours.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Weather and Best Time to Visit</h2>
    <p>Puerto Escondido enjoys a tropical climate, with warm temperatures year-round. The best time to visit is during the
        dry season, from November to April, when the weather is most pleasant and there's minimal rainfall. We visited during
        the Easter holidays, which is a busy time, but the vibrant atmosphere made it worthwhile. </p>


    <h2>Our Adventure in Puerto Escondido</h2>
    <p>On our first day, we explored the beaches near our accommodation. Despite the Easter crowds and strong waves that
        made swimming less enjoyable, we understood why Puerto Escondido is a surfer's paradise. The waves were impressive, and
        watching the surfers was exhilarating.<br>
        In the evening, I had the unique experience of releasing a baby turtle at a local NGO dedicated to turtle conservation.
        It was a touching moment, seeing the tiny creature make its way to the sea.<br>
        The following day, we sought out a quieter beach for swimming and relaxing. The tranquil setting was perfect for
        unwinding and enjoying the natural beauty of the area. That evening, we visited Laguna de Manialtepec to witness the
        magical bioluminescence. Swimming in the lagoon and seeing the plankton glow around us was an awe-inspiring experience
        that we'll never forget.</p>
