    <p> One Sunday in September, I embarked on my first journey to Atlixco, a picturesque town just about three quarters of an
        hour away from Cholula/Puebla. Known for its beautiful landscapes and rich cultural traditions, Atlixco offers visitors
        a delightful blend of history, art, and festivities.

    <h2>Getting to Atlixco</h2>

    <p> Atlixco is conveniently located and can be easily accessed by various means:
    <ul>
        <li><span>By Car</span>: The drive from Cholula or Puebla to Atlixco takes approximately 45 minutes.
            Renting a car provides flexibility and convenience for exploring the area. </li>
        <li><span>By Bus</span>: Regular bus services run from Puebla to Atlixco, making it an affordable and straightforward option.
            The journey takes about an hour.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2>Weather and Best Time to Visit</h2>

    <p>Atlixco enjoys a temperate climate, making it an ideal destination year-round. However, visiting during September and
        December offers unique experiences with local festivals and seasonal events.</p>


    <h2>Our Atlixco Adventure</h2>

    <p>During our visit in September, we wandered around the charming old town center, which was bustling with activity due
        to a local feria (fair). The vibrant stalls and festive atmosphere provided a wonderful glimpse into the local culture and
        community.</p>

    <p>Atlixco bears a resemblance to Cholula, particularly with its church perched on a hill. Climbing up to the church rewarded us
        with a stunning view of the surrounding countryside. Along the way, we witnessed the incredible performance of the Voladores de Papantla,
        an ancient tradition practiced for over a thousand years in honor of the gods of fertility. Watching the voladores descend
        gracefully from a 30-meter-high pole was a breathtaking experience.</p>

    <p>In October, I returned to Atlixco and was greeted by Catrina figures set up in various locations around the town. These
        iconic skeleton figures symbolize Dia de los Muertos and trace their origins to the painter Jose Guadalupe Posada, who
        created the ‘Calavera Garbancera’ in 1912. Posada’s figure criticized domestic workers aspiring to the lifestyle of wealthy
        ladies in post-revolutionary Mexico City, and today, Catrinas are a vibrant part of Mexican culture and festivities. </p>
