        <p>
          In April, we spent a few unforgettable days in Puerto Escondido, a
          coastal town in Oaxaca, Mexico. Known for its stunning beaches and
          vibrant surf culture, Puerto Escondido offers a blend of adventure and
          relaxation that's hard to find elsewhere.

        <h2>Getting to Puerto Escondido</h2>

        <p>Puerto Escondido is accessible by various means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span>By Plane</span>: The closest airport is Puerto Escondido
            International Airport (PXM), which is just a short drive from the
            town center. Direct flights are available from Mexico City and other
            major Mexican cities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>By Bus</span>: There are several bus services from Oaxaca
            City, taking about 10-12 hours due to the winding mountain roads.
            It’s a scenic, albeit lengthy, journey.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>By Car</span>: Renting a car can provide more flexibility for
            exploring the surrounding areas. The drive from Oaxaca City takes
            approximately seven hours.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Weather and Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <p>
          Puerto Escondido enjoys a tropical climate, with warm temperatures
          year-round. The best time to visit is during the dry season, from
          November to April, when the weather is most pleasant and there's
          minimal rainfall. We visited during the Easter holidays, which is a
          busy time, but the vibrant atmosphere made it worthwhile.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Adventure in Puerto Escondido</h2>
        <p>
          On our first day, we explored the beaches near our accommodation.
          Despite the Easter crowds and strong waves that made swimming less
          enjoyable, we understood why Puerto Escondido is a surfer's paradise.
          The waves were impressive, and watching the surfers was
          exhilarating.<br />
          In the evening, I had the unique experience of releasing a baby turtle
          at a local NGO dedicated to turtle conservation. It was a touching
          moment, seeing the tiny creature make its way to the sea.<br />
          The following day, we sought out a quieter beach for swimming and
          relaxing. The tranquil setting was perfect for unwinding and enjoying
          the natural beauty of the area. That evening, we visited Laguna de
          Manialtepec to witness the magical bioluminescence. Swimming in the
          lagoon and seeing the plankton glow around us was an awe-inspiring
          experience that we'll never forget.
