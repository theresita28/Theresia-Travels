        <h2>Getting to Cancún</h2>
        <p>
          We flew from Mexico City to Cancún, a convenient and quick flight that
          allowed us to start our journey with ease. Cancún International
          Airport (CUN) is well-connected with numerous direct flights from
          major cities around the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Weather and Best Time to Visit</h2>
        <p>
          Cancún boasts a tropical climate, making it a year-round destination.
          However, the best time to visit is during the dry season, from
          December to April, when the weather is warm and sunny, perfect for
          beach activities and exploring.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Cancún Adventure</h2>
        <h3>Day 1: Arrival</h3>
        <p>
          We arrived late at our accommodation and decided to take it easy,
          resting up for the adventures ahead.
        </p>

        <h3>Day 2: Chichen Itza and Cenote Tour</h3>
        <p>
          We booked a tour that took us to the magnificent Chichen Itza, one of
          the New Seven Wonders of the World. Before visiting the ancient Mayan
          ruins, we did a brief city tour of Valladolid, a charming colonial
          town. We also visited a local market where we shopped for Mexican
          crafts and enjoyed a delicious buffet.<br />
          Chichen Itza was breathtaking, with its iconic pyramid and fascinating
          history. After exploring the ruins, we headed to a cenote, a natural
          karst cave filled with fresh water. Despite the rain, taking a dip in
          the cenote and experiencing the tequila tasting was a unique
          highlight.
        </p>

        <h3>Day 3: Beach Day at Playa Delfines</h3>
        <p>
          We dedicated this day to relaxing at Playa Delfines in the Zona
          Hotelera. This stunning beach, with its soft white sand and
          crystal-clear waters, was perfect for unwinding. We spent a few hours
          there before walking along the coast to another beautiful public
          beach.

        <h3>Day 4: Isla Mujeres</h3>
        <p>
          We took a trip to Isla Mujeres, spending the afternoon at Playa Norte,
          known for its pristine waters and lively atmosphere. Although it was
          more crowded, the beach was spectacular. In the evening, we visited a
          bar where we enjoyed margaritas and joined a Mexican couple
          celebrating their wedding anniversary for some dancing and tequila
          shots.
